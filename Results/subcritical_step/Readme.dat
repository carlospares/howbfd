all the files *.txt contain 6 columns
x h_{initial}, q_{initial}, h, q, H

*_per_*.txt is the case with a perturbation 10^{-6} in a subcritical flow over a bed with step
*_per_nc*.txt is the same case but WITHOUT the topograpgy reconstruction

ATTENTION eta_{initial} has the pertrubation on top of the steady state.
